        FAQs
        1. WHAT ARE WE GOING TO USE FROM TKINTER (SOME ADVANCE ELEMENTS)?
        => TopLevel Widget for creating a new top level window, threading library for doing some tasks parallely, drag and drop func., event handeling, animation, etc..

        2. WHAT IS THE BASIC IDEA OF OUR PROJECT?
        => The basic idea is to have a simple app where we could drag or kind of upload a file or a folder to encrypt into, as a result the original file/folder would be transferred to our vault, and can only be decrypted by the person who is logged in and is entitled to the file or folder. Other functionalitites are, deletion of the same, exporting(moving it out from our app), etc..
